# Projects

Lets break into distinct sub headings. The idea here is to not replace the OSM wiki but as a way to promote/complement. Any idea that gets some traction, will be added to the OSM Ottawa wiki (others where appropiate).

## Rural Project

+ The Bancroft task was an idea I’ve had about rural mapping. Who looks after these areas? I still need to draft a lessons learned from the task with your help and feedback + look at Alex Barth’s NYC import blog to describe best practices.
 + My thinking for a rural project would focus on infrastructure that doesn’t change much; roads, buildings, parks, trails etc. The POI stuff changes way too quick to keep update by anyone other than local mappers. I’ve heard the TomTom’s POI database goes through ~ 60% change per year.
 + Alot of this is applicable elsewhere.
