+ Perhaps a bit further down the road is map layers like the latest national road network data diffed across the current OSM road network to show where changes have happened?
 + This gets me thinking about other broad map layers we could generate.
+ Get involved with MapRoulette
  + Work out some specific issues in our neck of the world
    + Denis had mentioned in the Bancroft task, that the lake tag? is missing from CanVec imports?
+ Down the road
 + OSMAnd updates available for Canada that are quicker than regular updates from app.
  + Perhaps weekly to start?
    + When I find time, I want to play with this on my local machine.
+ Would love to see some more discussion about using Denisâ€™s geocoder to help us find problems to drive folks to.
