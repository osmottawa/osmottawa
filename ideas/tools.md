+ Task manager is so awesome. Very impressed with the little experiment in Bancroft and I’d like to see this go bigger. Denis had a good point in an email about lets fire up our own up in an Amazon instance.
 + I’d add to this that we should definitely do this but promote it Canada wide. Task manager makes mapping so much easier to organize and coordinate (this would be excellent use of our sponsor money!).
  + We’d have to ensure decent backups are in place for the mapping tasks people would create
  + Admin type stuff like to work out
   + Who would have access to the servers to add folks?
